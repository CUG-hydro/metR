I get this note. It seems like a false positive since I can browse the URLs with no problems.

  Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
    URL: https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Standard_atmosphere
      From: man/standard_atmosphere.Rd
      Status: Error
      Message: libcurl error code 60:
        	SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
        	(Status without verification: OK)


Thanks for all the work :)
